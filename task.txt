- Deploy the code on a public github repository and rent the url of the repository as a reply of this message.
Optional:

Note:
1. Please provide special instructions(if any) to make to code base run on our local/remote platform.
2. Only implement what is mentioned in brief, i.e. only the API, no front-end things etc. The codes will never be deployed, we just want to see your coding skills.
3. There isn't a strict deadline. The faster the better, however code quality (and implementing it as mentioned in brief) is the most important.
4. If anything isn't clear, just implement it according to your understanding. There won't be any further explanations, the task is clear. As long as what you do doesn't contradict the briefing, it's fine.
5. Please let us know how much did it take to complete the task.
